            <h2>My Avatar</h2>

            <figure>
                <a href="images/my-avatar-lg.jpg" target="_blank">
                    <img src="images/my-avatar-thumb.jpg" alt="My Avatar Image" width="250" height="375">
                </a>
                <figcaption>My Avatar</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p> My avatar is Wonder Woman, a powerful superhero known for her strength, wisdom, and compassion. Wonder
                Woman's real name is Diana, and she hails from the island of Themyscira. She is an Amazonian princess
                who uses her abilities to fight for justice, love, and peace in the world of man. I chose Wonder Woman
                as my avatar because she embodies the qualities I aspire to have: courage, resilience, and a strong
                sense of justice.</p>

            <p> Wonder Woman was created by William Moulton Marston and first appeared in All Star Comics #8 in 1941.
                She
                has since become one of the most iconic superheroes in popular culture, representing female empowerment
                and the fight against oppression. Her creation was groundbreaking at a time when female superheroes were
                rare, and she quickly became a symbol of hope and strength for many women.</p>

            <p> As an Amazonian princess, Diana was raised in a society of warrior women, trained from a young age in
                combat and diplomacy. Her abilities are extraordinary, including superhuman strength, agility, and
                speed, as well as the power of flight. She also wields the Lasso of Truth, which forces anyone bound by
                it to tell the truth, and her indestructible bracelets can deflect bullets. These tools, combined with
                her fierce fighting skills, make her a formidable opponent in any battle. </p>

            <p> But beyond her physical prowess, Wonder Woman is also known for her deep compassion and unwavering
                commitment to justice. She doesn't fight merely for the sake of battle; she fights to protect the
                innocent and to bring peace to the world. Her mission is not only to defeat her enemies but also to
                change their hearts and minds, striving for a world where love and understanding prevail over hatred and
                violence. </p>

            <p> In many ways, Wonder Woman represents the ideal blend of strength and compassion. She is not only a
                warrior but also a diplomat, always seeking to resolve conflicts peacefully when possible. This duality
                is what makes her such a powerful and inspiring figure. She teaches us that true strength is not just
                about physical power but also about the ability to show kindness, empathy, and understanding even in the
                face of adversity. </p>

            <p> Wonder Woman's origin story is deeply rooted in mythology, drawing on the rich traditions of Greek
                mythology. Her mother, Queen Hippolyta, crafted her from clay, and she was given life by the gods of
                Olympus. These mythological roots add depth to her character, connecting her to the ancient stories of
                heroism and adventure that have inspired countless generations. </p>

            <p> Over the years, Wonder Woman's character has evolved, reflecting the changing attitudes and values of
                society. In the 1970s, for example, she became a feminist icon, symbolizing the fight for women's rights
                and equality. Her stories often tackled social issues such as sexism, racism, and war, making her a
                powerful voice for justice in a world that was, and still is, in need of change. </p>

            <p> In recent years, Wonder Woman has continued to be a symbol of female empowerment, particularly with the
                release of the 2017 film Wonder Woman, directed by Patty Jenkins. The film was a critical and commercial
                success, further cementing Wonder Woman's status as a cultural icon. Gal Gadot's portrayal of the
                character brought a new level of depth and nuance, showing her not just as a warrior but as a
                compassionate and empathetic leader. </p>

            <p> In choosing Wonder Woman as my avatar, I am inspired by her ability to remain true to her values no
                matter the challenges she faces. She is a beacon of hope in a world that often seems dark and unjust.
                Her courage, resilience, and unwavering sense of justice are qualities that I strive to emulate in my
                own life. Just as Wonder Woman fights for a better world, I too hope to make a positive impact, standing
                up for what is right and helping those in need. </p>

            <p> Ultimately, Wonder Woman reminds us all that we have the power within ourselves to make a difference.
                Whether through acts of kindness, standing up for others, or simply being true to our principles, we can
                all be heroes in our own way. Wonder Woman's legacy is a testament to the power of belief in oneself and
                the importance of fighting for a world where justice and love prevail. </p>

                <figcaption>Web Development Journey</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p> As part of my journey in this web development class, I have been learning several essential skills and
                techniques that are crucial for building modern websites. These skills form the backbone of web
                development and are vital for creating websites that are not only functional but also visually appealing
                and accessible to a wide audience. Here's a brief overview of what I've learned so far:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>HTML5:</strong> Understanding the structure of web pages using semantic tags, block
                    elements, and inline elements. HTML5 is the foundation of any web page, providing the basic
                    structure that other technologies like CSS and JavaScript build upon. Learning HTML5 has taught me
                    how to effectively use tags such as header, footer, article, and section , which help define
                    the different sections of a web page in a way that is meaningful to both users and search engines.
                    Semantic HTML not only improves the accessibility of web pages but
                    also makes the code more readable and easier to maintain.</li>

                <li><strong>CSS:</strong> Styling web pages to make them visually appealing and user-friendly. CSS
                    (Cascading Style Sheets) is the language used to control the presentation of web pages. Through CSS,
                    I have learned how to apply styles such as colors, fonts, and layouts, transforming plain HTML
                    documents into aesthetically pleasing web pages. CSS has introduced me to the concept of the box
                    model, which is crucial for understanding how elements are spaced and aligned on a page.
                    Additionally, I have explored various layout techniques, including flexbox and grid, which allow for
                    more complex and responsive designs. Mastering CSS is essential for creating a user-friendly
                    experience, as it directly impacts how users interact with and perceive a website.</li>

                <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> Adding interactivity to web pages and enhancing user experience.
                    JavaScript is a powerful scripting language that allows developers to create dynamic and interactive
                    web content. By learning JavaScript, I have gained the ability to manipulate the Document Object
                    Model (DOM), which represents the structure of an HTML document. This has enabled me to create
                    features such as form validation, interactive menus, and dynamic content updates without the need
                    for a page reload. JavaScript is also the key to implementing more complex functionality like
                    animations, event handling, and AJAX, which allows for asynchronous data loading. Through
                    JavaScript, I have come to appreciate the importance of enhancing user experience by making web
                    pages more engaging and responsive to user actions.</li>

                <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> Ensuring that websites look great on all devices, from desktops
                    to smartphones. Responsive design is a critical aspect of modern web development, as it ensures that
                    websites are accessible and functional across a variety of devices and screen sizes. I have learned
                    how to use CSS media queries to apply different styles based on the size and orientation of the
                    user's screen. This knowledge has allowed me to create flexible layouts that adapt to different
                    devices, providing an optimal viewing experience whether the user is on a desktop computer, tablet,
                    or smartphone. Responsive design also emphasizes the importance of mobile-first design, where
                    websites are initially designed for smaller screens and then enhanced for larger screens. This
                    approach ensures that all users, regardless of their device, can easily navigate and interact with
                    the website.</li>
            </ul>

            <p> Each of these skills has its own unique challenges and rewards. For example, mastering HTML5 helps
                create a solid foundation for any web page, while learning CSS allows for creative and attractive
                designs. JavaScript brings life to web pages by enabling dynamic content and user interactions. Lastly,
                responsive design ensures that my websites are accessible and functional on any device, providing a
                seamless experience for all users.</p>

            <p> In addition to these core skills, I have also learned the importance of web accessibility, which
                involves designing websites that can be used by people with disabilities. This includes implementing
                features such as alt text for images, keyboard navigation, and ensuring that the website is navigable by
                screen readers. Accessibility is a crucial consideration in web development, as it ensures that all
                users, regardless of their abilities, can access and benefit from the content on the web.</p>

            <p> Overall, my web development journey has been incredibly rewarding, and I look forward to continuing to
                build my skills and create amazing web experiences. The knowledge I have gained so far has provided me
                with a strong foundation to tackle more advanced topics in the future, such as server-side programming,
                database integration, and web security. I am excited to continue exploring the vast field of web
                development and to apply my skills to create websites that are not only functional and beautiful but
                also accessible and inclusive for all users.</p>
