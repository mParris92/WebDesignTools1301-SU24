        <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Mianna Parris, 32 years old and I am currently taking this class as a course requirement for the degree I'm pursuing in CIT.Software Development A.A.S. My ultimate goal is to move closer to a University transfer to obtain my B.S in Computer Science. At this present time, I would as a Global Tech Analyst within FinTech and intend to contend for a position in our software engineering department or to extend my horizon to intern opportunities to gain hands on experience at an enterprise level. 

        Aside from my educational pursuits I enjoy life as a mom of 1, an 11 year old daughter, and I thoroughly enjoy designing in every capacity as I consider it a form of art which is my wy of releasing my creativity.
